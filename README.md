This is the code of the demo I gave during the Meteor talk at jsconfbe (http://jsconf.be).

These Meteor packages should be added to the project in the following way:

```
meteor add accounts-ui
meteor add accounts-password
meteor add bootstrap
meteor add mrt:twit
```

The file server/server.js should contain your Twitter API keys in order for this to work.
